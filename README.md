# Scikit-learn-Assignment

The objective of this project was to perform data analysis and apply machine learning algorithms over a data set that contains health information to predict if a person is more likely to have heart disease in the future.

The first part of this work is dedicated to reviewing and understanding the available data, then performing the necessary adjustments and transformations to apply multiple machine learning algorithms for classification. Finally, comparing the results to identify the best algorithm for this use case.

This repository includes the Python Notebook with the code implementation, the source files and the report submitted for the assignment.
